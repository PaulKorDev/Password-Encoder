# About what?
Password Encoder is an application for encoding your text with a special cipher.

Login and passwords are encoded in different ways. Letters and numbers are also encoded differently.

But the main advantage of my application is the ability to decrypt your encrypted text without an application, you only need to look at your encrypted text and you will understand what is written here, but for other people it will look like a crazy set of characters. 

The console version works, but the WinForms version probably doesn't, because I broke it when I was trying to add new features)))
